# Faculty-Student Database Integration

## Overview
Successfully implemented full database connectivity between faculty and student portals. Faculty can now create and manage content that students can view in real-time.

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### Database Models
Added new models to support dashboard features:

1. **Announcement** - Site-wide announcements by faculty
   - Fields: title, message, author_id, created_at, expires_at
   - Faculty can create, students can view active announcements

2. **Event** - Upcoming college events
   - Fields: title, description, start_time, end_time, location, created_by
   - Faculty can create, students can view upcoming events

3. **Activity** - Recent activities/audit log
   - Fields: type, title, details, created_by, created_at
   - Auto-created when faculty performs actions (e.g., marking attendance)
   - Students can view recent activities

4. **Enhanced Attendance** - Existing model now fully functional
   - Faculty can mark attendance for students
   - Students can view their attendance records with statistics

### Faculty API Endpoints (`/api/faculty/*`)
All endpoints support both JWT and session-based authentication:

1. **POST `/api/faculty/announcements`** - Create announcement
   - Body: `{title, message}`
   - Returns: Created announcement with ID

2. **GET `/api/faculty/announcements`** - List all announcements
   - Returns: Array of announcements

3. **POST `/api/faculty/events`** - Create event
   - Body: `{title, start_time, end_time, location, description}`
   - Returns: Created event with ID

4. **GET `/api/faculty/events`** - List all events
   - Returns: Array of events ordered by start_time

5. **POST `/api/faculty/attendance`** - Mark attendance
   - Body: `{subject_id, date, attendance_data: [{student_id, status}]}`
   - Returns: Success message with count of students marked
   - Automatically creates an Activity record

6. **GET `/api/faculty/activities`** - View recent activities
   - Returns: Array of recent activities

### Student API Endpoints (`/api/student/*`)
All endpoints support both JWT and session-based authentication:

1. **GET `/api/student/announcements`** - View announcements
   - Returns: Active announcements (not expired)
   - Ordered by created_at descending

2. **GET `/api/student/upcoming-events`** - View upcoming events
   - Returns: Events with start_time in the future
   - Ordered by start_time ascending

3. **GET `/api/student/my-attendance`** - View own attendance
   - Query params: `subject_id`, `start_date`, `end_date` (optional)
   - Returns: Attendance records + statistics (percentage, present, absent)

4. **GET `/api/student/recent-activities`** - View recent activities
   - Returns: Recent activities created by faculty

## üîí Authentication System
Implemented hybrid authentication that supports both:

1. **JWT Tokens** - For API-based access
   - Used by external clients or API consumers
   - Requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header

2. **Session-based Auth** - For web interface
   - Used by the main web application
   - Stored in Flask session
   - Automatically works with existing login system

### Implementation Details
- Created `require_faculty_auth()` decorator for faculty endpoints
- Created `require_student_auth()` decorator for student endpoints
- Helper functions:
  - `get_current_user_email()` - Gets email from JWT or session
  - `get_current_faculty_id()` / `get_current_student_id()` - Gets user ID

## üìä Database Schema Updates

### New Tables Created
```sql
-- Announcements
CREATE TABLE announcements (
    announcement_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    author_id INTEGER REFERENCES faculty(faculty_id),
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    expires_at DATETIME
);

-- Events
CREATE TABLE events (
    event_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    start_time DATETIME,
    end_time DATETIME,
    location VARCHAR(200),
    created_by INTEGER REFERENCES faculty(faculty_id)
);

-- Activities
CREATE TABLE activities (
    activity_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    type VARCHAR(50),
    title VARCHAR(200),
    details TEXT,
    created_by INTEGER REFERENCES faculty(faculty_id),
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## ‚úÖ Test Results

### Dashboard DB Test (scripts/run_dashboard_db_test.py)
- ‚úÖ Create announcement: Status 201
- ‚úÖ Create event: Status 201  
- ‚úÖ Mark attendance: Status 200 (2 students marked)
- ‚úÖ List announcements: Status 200
- ‚úÖ List events: Status 200
- ‚úÖ List activities: Status 200

### Integration Test (scripts/test_student_faculty_integration.py)
**Faculty Actions:**
- ‚úÖ Created announcement "Mid-term Exam Schedule"
- ‚úÖ Created event "Guest Lecture on AI"
- ‚úÖ Marked attendance for 2 students

**Student Views:**
- ‚úÖ Viewed 1 announcement
- ‚úÖ Viewed 1 upcoming event
- ‚úÖ Viewed attendance (100% present)
- ‚úÖ Viewed 1 recent activity

## üìù Usage Examples

### Faculty Creating Content

```python
# Create announcement
POST /api/faculty/announcements
{
    "title": "Mid-term Exam Schedule",
    "message": "Exams will be held from Oct 20-25"
}

# Create event
POST /api/faculty/events
{
    "title": "Guest Lecture on AI",
    "start_time": "2025-10-15T14:00:00",
    "location": "Auditorium A"
}

# Mark attendance
POST /api/faculty/attendance
{
    "subject_id": 101,
    "date": "2025-10-08",
    "attendance_data": [
        {"student_id": 1, "status": "present"},
        {"student_id": 2, "status": "absent"}
    ]
}
```

### Students Viewing Content

```python
# View announcements
GET /api/student/announcements
# Returns all active announcements

# View upcoming events
GET /api/student/upcoming-events
# Returns future events

# View my attendance
GET /api/student/my-attendance?subject_id=101
# Returns attendance records with statistics
```

## üéØ Next Steps (Recommended)

### 1. Frontend UI Implementation
- Create faculty forms to add announcements/events
- Create student dashboard widgets to display:
  - Recent announcements
  - Upcoming events  
  - Attendance statistics
  - Recent activities

### 2. Enhanced Features
- Add file attachments to announcements
- Add RSVP functionality for events
- Add push notifications for new announcements
- Add attendance reports and analytics
- Add calendar view for events

### 3. Permissions & Authorization
- Add role-based access control for different faculty levels
- Add subject-specific permissions for attendance marking
- Add announcement categories/visibility controls

### 4. Database Migrations
- Generate Flask-Migrate migrations for production deployment
- Create database backup/restore procedures

## üîß Technical Notes

### Files Modified
- `models/gecr_models.py` - Added Announcement, Event, Activity models
- `database.py` - Registered new models for table creation
- `routes/faculty_routes.py` - Added endpoints for announcements, events, activities, attendance
- `routes/student_routes.py` - Added endpoints for viewing faculty content
- `routes/__init__.py` - Enabled blueprint imports

### Configuration
- Database: SQLite (development), configurable for PostgreSQL/MySQL
- Authentication: Hybrid JWT + Session support
- ORM: SQLAlchemy with relationship mapping

### Performance Considerations
- Announcements limited to 20 recent items
- Events limited to 20 upcoming items
- Activities limited to 10 recent items
- Consider pagination for larger datasets

## üìö API Documentation

Full API documentation available at `/api/docs` endpoint.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: 401 Unauthorized
- Ensure you're logged in (session-based) or passing JWT token
- Check user_type in session/JWT matches endpoint (faculty vs student)

### Issue: 404 Not Found
- Verify blueprints are registered in app.py
- Check route prefixes: `/api/faculty/*` or `/api/student/*`

### Issue: 500 Internal Server Error
- Check database tables are created: `db.create_all()`
- Verify model imports in route files
- Check application logs for detailed error messages

## ‚ú® Summary
The faculty-student database integration is now fully functional! Faculty members can create announcements, events, and mark attendance, while students can view all this information in real-time through the API endpoints. The system supports both JWT and session-based authentication for maximum flexibility.
