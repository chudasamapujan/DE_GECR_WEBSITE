**✅ CRITICAL SUCCESS:** Badge shows "1" (or number of unread notifications)

**Visual Reference:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Dashboard          [Settings]  │
│                                 │
│                    🔔(1) [👤]  │ ← Badge here!
│                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**🐛 If Badge is NOT Visible:**
1. Open browser console (F12 → Console tab)
2. Look for JavaScript errors
3. Check Network tab → Should see call to `/api/student/notifications`
4. Verify response has `unread_count: 1`

---

### STEP 6: Open Notification Dropdown

2. Dropdown should slide down below bell

├────────────────────────────────┤
│  [Mark all as read]            │
└────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### STEP 7: Mark Notification as Read
1. **Click anywhere** on the notification item
2. Observe changes:

**✅ Success Indicator:**
- Notification background changes from blue to white/gray
- Text becomes semi-transparent (grayed out)
- Badge count decreases: "1" → disappears
- (If link exists, page navigates)

**Before Click:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────┐

Badge: (gone)
```

### STEP 8: Test Auto-Refresh (Polling)
1. Keep student dashboard open
2. Switch back to faculty window (or open new faculty window)
3. Create ANOTHER announcement:
   - Title: "Second Test Announcement"
   - Message: "Testing real-time polling"
4. Switch back to student window
5. **Wait 30 seconds** (or less if polling interval is shorter)

**✅ Success Indicator:**
- Badge reappears with "1"
- Dropdown automatically shows new notification (if opened)
- No manual refresh needed!

**Timeline:**
```
0:00 - Faculty creates announcement
0:05 - Student still sees badge: (0)
0:30 - Polling triggers → API call → Badge updates to (1)
0:31 - Student sees new notification!
```

---

### STEP 9: Test "Mark All as Read"
1. Create 2-3 more test announcements (as faculty)
2. Wait for student dashboard to show multiple unread (e.g., badge shows "3")
3. Click bell to open dropdown
4. Click "Mark all as read" button at bottom

**✅ Success Indicator:**
- All notifications gray out simultaneously
- Badge disappears immediately
- Dropdown shows all notifications as read

   - Start Time: Tomorrow 10:00 AM
   - End Time: Tomorrow 5:00 PM
   - Location: "Main Auditorium"
3. Click "Create Event"

4. As student, check notifications:
