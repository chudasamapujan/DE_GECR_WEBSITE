   - Go to Students page
   - Try:
     - **Upload Excel** button → Select `.xlsx` file
     - **Add Student** button → Fill form manually
     - Use search/filters

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Excel Parser (`utils/student_parser.py`)

**Two parsing methods:**
1. `parse_students_excel()` - Uses pandas (recommended)
2. `parse_students_excel_openpyxl()` - Uses openpyxl (fallback)

**Features:**
- ✅ Flexible column name matching (handles variations)
- ✅ Email validation with regex
- ✅ Required field checking
- ✅ Default values for optional fields
- ✅ Detailed error reporting

**Column variations supported:**
- "Roll No" / "roll_no" / "rollno" / "Roll Number"
- "Name" / "Student Name" / "name"
- "Email" / "email" / "Email Address"
- etc.

### API Authentication

All endpoints use:
- **Cookie-based sessions** (for browser)
- **JWT tokens** (for API clients)
- **@faculty_required** or **@student_required** decorators

### Database Queries

**Optimized queries:**
- Uses `.join()` for relationships
- Filters applied in database (not Python)
- Attendance calculated with SQL aggregations
- Pagination ready (can add later)
